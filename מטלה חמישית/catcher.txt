If you really want to hear about it, the first thing youll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I dont feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them. Theyre quitee touchy about anything like that, especially my father. Theyre nice and all - Im not saying that - but theyre also touchy as hell. Besides, Im not going to tell you my whole goodam autobiography or anything. Ill just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out and take it easy. I mean thats all I told D.B. about, and hes my brother and all. Hes in Hollywood. That isnt too far from this crumby place, and he comes over and visits me practically every week end. Hes going to drive me home when I go home next month maybe. He just got a Jaguar. One of those little English jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour. It cost him damn near four thousand bucks. Hes got a lot of dough, now. He didnt use to. He used to be just a regular writer, when he was home. He wrote thizs terrific book of short stories, The Secret Goldfish, in case you never heard of him. The best one in it was The Secret Goldfish. It was about this little kid that wouldnt let anybody look at his goldfish because hed bought it with his own money. It killed me. Now hes out in Hollywood, D.B., being a prostitute. If theres one thing I hate, its the movies. Dont even mention them to me.
